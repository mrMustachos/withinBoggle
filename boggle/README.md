## WITHIN Boggle

Let's start out by saying that I've never played boggle before so I had a ton of research to do to make sure I even got close to building this thing correctly.

### Assumptions I’ve Made:
  - I originally was trying to do this by hitting a dictionary API but quickly learned that was not going work because of the volume of checks I needed to do. I found out the Boggle uses the official Scrabble wordlist so I managed to find the 2015 list as a text file and I’m using that.

  - I based all the default Boggle rules off the [Wiki How’s: How to Play Boggle] (https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Boggle). I only deviated from these rules to add WITHIN Boggle’s rules.

  - Dice configurations came from one of the many Boggle forums I visited in my research to build this game.

## Install:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
  - Open [http://localhost:3000/] (http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
